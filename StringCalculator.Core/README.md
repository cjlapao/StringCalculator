## Infrastructure Layer or Domain Layer

In here we will have all of the needed infrastructure to use in any other 
software to calculate the values. this will allow us to build separately from
the application layer allowing the to grow a different paces.

This also contains the custom exceptions that are needed and required by the
exercise. We could have risen an exception with the custom message but I think
it helps more to have custom exceptions that will help debug in case we need 
it.
